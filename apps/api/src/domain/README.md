/**
 * Domain Layer
 * 
 * This folder contains:
 * - Domain entities with business rules and logic
 * - Domain interfaces (ports) for infrastructure layer implementations
 * - Value objects
 * - Domain events
 * 
 * Domain entities should be framework-agnostic and contain core business logic.
 * They define interfaces (ports) that infrastructure layers will implement.
 * 
 * Currently empty - will be populated as domain logic is implemented.
